- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Fab4ever.
- I live in Belgium.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in website development. I've been maintaining a website for my cycling team since 1999. 
I registered an own domainname for the website (www.trappers.be) in 2002.
The site has since then had some restyling, but mostly only 'cosmetic' (colors, fonts, etc.).
End 2019 the site was rebuild and incorporated some responsive design and CSS.
Nowadays (December 2021) I'm rebuilding the site again. It's will now be really fully responsive and usable on different devices (pc, smartphone, tablet).
The new structure uses php to include navigation and recurring parts of the site.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning php and CSS.
